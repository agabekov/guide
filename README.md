# Kaspi Guide

This repository contains user-facing guides and reference materials for Kaspi products and services. It is organized by product and topic, primarily in Markdown format.

## Structure

- Product areas are grouped into top-level folders (for example, `Автокредит на Новое Авто`, `Kaspi Gold`, `Переводы`).
- Inside each folder, individual guides live as `.md` files, usually one scenario or question per file.
- Supporting materials (spreadsheets, PDFs) are kept at the root when they apply across multiple sections.
